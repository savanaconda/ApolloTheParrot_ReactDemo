# Apollo the Parrot App

Welcome to my **Apollo the Parrot** app. Apollo is a famous parrot who identifies objects, materials, etc. [Learn more about him here](https://apolloandfrens.com/pages/about-us).

This app lets you give an object to Apollo to identify. He will inspect the object and tell you what it is made out of.

To try it out, download this code and run `npm start` in the code directory. This should start up the server and open a browser window at address `http://localhost:3000/` where you can play with app and interact with Apollo.

Below are additional details on **Create React App**, which I used to help create this app.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
